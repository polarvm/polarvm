/// DAGdeltaAlgorithm - Implements a "delta debugging" algorithm for minimizing
/// directed acyclic graphs using a predicate function.
///
/// The result of the algorithm is a subset of the input change set which is
/// guaranteed to satisfy the predicate, assuming that the input set did. For
/// well formed predicates, the result set is guaranteed to be such that
/// removing any single element not required by the dependencies on the other
/// elements would falsify the predicate.
///
/// The DAG should be used to represent dependencies in the changes which are
/// likely to hold across the predicate function. That is, for a particular
/// changeset S and predicate P:
///
///   P(S) => P(S union pred(S))
///
/// The minization algorithm uses this dependency information to attempt to
/// eagerly prune large subsets of changes. As with \see DeltaAlgorithm, the DAG
/// is not required to satisfy this property, but the algorithm will run
/// substantially fewer tests with appropriate dependencies. \see DeltaAlgorithm
/// for more information on the properties which the predicate function itself
/// should satisfy.

/// The result of the algorithm is a subset of the input change set which is

/// removing any single element would falsify the predicate.
///
/// For best results the predicate function *should* (but need not) satisfy
/// certain properties, in particular:
///  (1) The predicate should return false on an empty set and true on the full
///  set.
///  (2) If the predicate returns true for a set of changes, it should return
///  true for all supersets of that set.
///
/// It is not an error to provide a predicate that does not satisfy these
/// requirements, and the algorithm will generally produce reasonable
/// results. However, it may run substantially more tests than with a good
/// predicate.
